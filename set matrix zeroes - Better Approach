In brute force approach we traverse the matrix and is we found any cell containing 0 then we record the entire row and col of that cell
In better Approach we'll keep trach of that row and col
we'll create row and col array in which we track the row and col for any cell containing 0 we mark row and col of that cell in their respectve row and col array
After that we traverse the matrix again and if in any situation row is marked or column is marked we mark the cell with 0

//better appproach
class Solution {
    public void setZeroes(int[][] matrix) {
        //create row and col array for marking
        boolean[] row = new boolean[matrix.length];
        boolean[] col = new boolean[matrix[0].length];
        //traverse the matrix
        for(int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < matrix[0].length; j++){
                if(matrix[i][j] ==0){
                    row[i] = true;;
                    col[j] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        //traversing the matrix again to mark cells with respect to row and col array
        for(int i =0; i < matrix.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < matrix[0].length; j++){
                if(row[i] || col[j]){
                    matrix[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Time complexity = O(2 * n * m)
space complexity = O(m + n)
